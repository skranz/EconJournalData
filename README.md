This is the source code of my Shiny app to search among economic articles with data and code supplement. You can access the app here:

[http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:3200/ejd/](http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:3200/ejd/)

I did not include the code that has built and updates the underlying database via webscrapping. Instead you can simply download the zipped SQLite databases with the collected information about articles and data supplements from my server:

<ul>
<li>
Main database (should suffices for most analyses):<br><a href="http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ejd/articles.zip">http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ejd/articles.zip</a>
</li><li>
 Large database containing names and sizes of all files in the data and code supplements:<br><a href="http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ejd/articles.zip">http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ejd/files.zip</a> 
</li>
</ul>

I plan to regularly update the databases.
