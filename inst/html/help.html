This is an R <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny</a> app to search for economic articles that have provided data and code for replication purposes.
</p><p>
This can be used e.g. for teaching economics and data science. For example, my students can use the app to find an interesting topic for a Bachelor or Master Thesis in form of an interactive analysis with <a href="https://github.com/skranz/RTutor" target="_blank">RTutor</a> .
</p><p>
The main feature is a keyword search in the article's titles and abstracts. It returns a list with links to the articles on their journal websites and some estimates of the sizes of data files and relevant code files. By default only articles are included that have a data or code supplement.
</p><p>
I also tried to find and extract a README file from each supplement. Most README files explain whether all results can be replicated with the provided data sets or whether some results require confidential or propietary data sets. The link allows you to look at the README without the need to download the whole data set.
</p><p>
The underlying database contains information about articles and data supplements collected for the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/" target="_blank">AEA journals</a> (including the American Economic Review, Journal of Economic Perspectives, AEA Policy, ...), the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/" target="_blank">Review of Economic Studies</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/rest" target="_blank">Review of Economic and Statistics</a>.
</p><p>
There are also small samples from the QJE, JPE and JAERE who for a long time did not seem to have such effective data availability policies than the other journals mentioned above.

If you want to analyse yourself the collected data, you can download the zipped Sqlite databases using the following links:

 Large database containing names and sizes of all files in the data and code supplements:<br><a href="http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ejd/articles.zip">http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ejd/files.zip</a>
