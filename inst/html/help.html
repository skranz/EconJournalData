<h4>Search Help</h4>
<ul>
<li>The keyword search does not distinguish between full words and parts of words. For example, if you want to search for articles about asymmetric information, you could enter the term <code style="white-space:nowrap">asymmetr information</code>. You then would equally well find articles whose title or abstract contains 'information asymmetry' or 'asymmetric information'</li>
<li>Use double-quotes to find exact phrases. For example, searching for <code style="white-space:nowrap">climate change</code> finds articles that contain the words 'climate' OR 'change'. Search for <code style="white-space:nowrap">"climate change"</code> if you only want to list articles whose abstract or title contains the phrase 'climate change'.</li>
<li>Try to avoid common words like <code>the</code>,<code>a</code>,<code>is</code> etc. This will probably return almost all articles since those words (or letter sequences) can be probably be found in almost all abstracts.</li>
<li>The keyword search does not distinguish between lower or upper case.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accessing Articles</h4>
Most search results provide a link to the article on the journal homepage. If your institutition has not subscribed to the journal, you can probably buy a single articly or try searching for the the article name in your favorite search engine. In economics, freely accessible working paper versions can often be found. For most journals, the data and code supplements are freely accessible to everyone. Only the JPE seems to have put the supplements behind a pay wall. If the data and code supplement cannot be found on the article page, an extra link is added to the search results (this is mostly the case for journals who host their data on dataverse).
